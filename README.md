# Password-Strength-Detector
This tool is for educational use only and should not be used for securing sensitive information.

This code takes passwords and informs the user if they are a strong, or hard to hack passowrd, a moderately good password or a weak and easy to hack password. This program is based on some common guidelines for passwords. Such as if a password is 8 characters or longer, if it uses capital and lower case letters, if it uses special characters, etc. 

I made this program using Visual Studio so I recommend using that, but any application compatible with java will work. Copy the repo and open it on your chosen application and it should run. 

WARNING: This program is for educaitonal purposes, so it is not a fully complex password checker. The criteria it goes off of follows standard strong password recommendations, but there is no guarantee that a password determined to be strong by this program is unhackable. Making even more secure passwords could be a good idea. This program also does not tell you why your password may be considered weak or moderate, it just tells you what level of strength it has. 

This program is meant to be used to help users better understand strong passwords, make sure they are using strong passwords, and test out various passwords to find strong ones and get in the habit of creating strong passwords. It is not meant to save peoples passwords without their consent. It is also not meant to be altered in a way to trick people and encourage them to ue weak passwords that they think are strong after using this program.
